# PhpXMP #

This package allows you to locate and extract XMP Metadata packets from various file formats in Pure PHP (which means
you can avoid the PECL extension).

## Testing ##

I am testing using the BlueSquare files supplied with Adobe's XMP Toolkit SDK. These are not in the repository due to
possible licensing concerns.
